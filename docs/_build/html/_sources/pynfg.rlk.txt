Introduction
------------

Relaxed Level K (rlk) is a solution concept in which players have bounded rationality.  Instead of
sampling from all possible strategies, players sample from a (possibly proper) subset of
their strategy space known as their satisficing distribution.  The players sample their
satisficing distribution M times for each possible value of the parents.  They then
sample the rest of the net M' times.  They then record which strategy yielded the highest
utility.  This process is repeated N times and the player's final strategy is the expected
value of maximal strategies 1...N.

RLK in parallel
----------------
Since, each player can be trained independently of the others at a given level, rlk is a prime candidate for parallel computing.  Using PyNFg makes this even easier.  To solve a game in parallel just do

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [9]: G_parallel = rlk_parallel(G, player_info, 10,3,1)
   Training Q1 at level 1
   Training Q2 at level 1
   Training Q1 at level 2
   Training Q2 at level 2
   Training Q1 at level 3
   Training Q2 at level 3

G_parallel is similar in nature to solver.G.  Making both players level 3, note the speedup

.. code-block:: ipython

   In [10]: %timeit -r1 -n1 G_parallel = rlk_parallel(G, player_info, 10,3,1)
   Training Q1 at level 1
   Training Q2 at level 1
   Training Q1 at level 2
   Training Q2 at level 2
   Training Q1 at level 3
   Training Q2 at level 3
   1 loops, best of 1: 6.35 s per loop

   In [11]: %timeit -r1 -n1 solver.solve_game()
   Training Q1 at level 1
   Training Q2 at level 1
   Training Q1 at level 2
   Training Q2 at level 2
   Training Q1 at level 3
   Training Q2 at level 3
   1 loops, best of 1: 12.8 s per loop
