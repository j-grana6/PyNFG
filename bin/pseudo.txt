For 104 priors
    Generate the net from a GDP schedule and flight schedule
    For strategy in range(15000)
    	Draw a strategy profile-S
	Instantiate social cost and airline cost variable *
	For every element in the space of the nature player *
	    Evaluate the strategies and determine social costs *
	    Update airline's cost and social cost, weighting by p(nature) *
	For each airline
	    Copy the net
	    For alternative in num_alternative_strats (30?)
	    	Draw an alternative strategy for airline
		Repeat * steps only for airline costs
	    Determine what percent of the alternatives yield higher costs 
	    than the initial strategy.
	    Assign above percentage to the intelligence of airline
	The intelligence of S is the product over airline intelligences
    Initiate expected_social_cost variable
    For post samp in range num_posterior samples
    	Sample a strategy from each of the 104 games and record the social cost
	Update the expected_social_cost to include \sum_{i=1}^{i=104}social_cost_i/104

   - Get a GDP schedule from your data set with airlines, flights, etc.
   - Create a game for that GDP schedule between those airlines, with those
   flights, etc.
   - for s in range(S)
   - for each airline i, draw a type-contingent strategy, x_i
      - for \theta in \Theta
         1. evaluate the type-contingent strategies at \theta to get the
         bids
         2. assign slots to airlines
         3. assign slots to flights
         4. evaluate social welfare, costs, profits, etc.
         5. weight the values in 4 by p(\theta)
      - record the expected value of social welfare, costs, profits, etc.
      by summing over \theta the values in 5.
      - for each airline i
         - for m in range(M)
            - draw an alternative strategy x'_i
            - for \theta in \Theta
               1. evaluate x'_i and x_{-i} at \theta to get the bids
               2. assign slots to airlines
               3. assign slots to flights
               4. evaluate social welfare, costs, profits, etc.
               5. weight the values in 4 by p(\theta)
            - record the expected value of social welfare, costs, profits,
            etc. by summing over \theta the values in 5.
         - IQ_i is the proportion of draws m in range(M) for which i's
         alternative strategies yield lower profits/higher costs than x_i above
      - assign weight G(IQ) = \prod_i G_i(IQ_i) to the expected value of
      social welfare, costs, profits, etc for profile x.



Why not do type contingent intelligences?  For example, draw a type 
contingent strategy for each player.  Then compute the intelligence of
the each typeXaction pair.  Then we can
