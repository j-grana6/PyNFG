For 104 priors
    Generate the net from a GDP schedule and flight schedule
    For strategy in range(15000)
    	Draw a strategy profile-S
	Instantiate social cost and airline cost variable *
	For every element in the space of the nature player *
	    Evaluate the strategies and determine social costs *
	    Update airline's cost and social cost, weighting by p(nature) *
	For each airline
	    Copy the net
	    For alternative in num_alternative_strats (30?)
	    	Draw an alternative strategy for airline
		Repeat * steps only for airline costs
	    Determine what percent of the alternatives yield higher costs 
	    than the initial strategy.
	    Assign above percentage to the intelligence of airline
	The intelligence of S is the product over airline intelligences
    Initiate expected_social_cost variable
    For post samp in range num_posterior samples
    	Sample a strategy from each of the 104 games and record the social cost
	Update the expected_social_cost to include \sum_{i=1}^{i=104}social_cost_i/104
